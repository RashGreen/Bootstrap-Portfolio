            <h1>Bio</h1>
            <p>I am a creator from the sunny left coast of the United States of America, I am currently in the process of learning to create Full Stack Web Applications in the hopes that I will be able to move on from my career in bartending.
            I know that with preservernce and persistance, I will begin to understand various coding languages. 
            I am truly excited for the day when I can freely discuss the differences between JavaScript and Python, C++ and Ruby on rails.
            In the future I plan to find funding to produce one of the various scripts I work on in my spare time.  
            Writing screenplays has always been an interest of mine and with the current explosion of long-format story telling that is becomming the norm, I feel that I would love to leave a mark in the TV world.
            In addition to writing teleplays every once in a blue moon a subject strikes me in such a way that I feel compelled to write about it, feel free to take some time to check out some of my Non-Fiction writings.
            When your done checking out things I am actually decent at feel free to check out something that I'm terrible at; like my Photography! If you've ever wondered what a person who has no eye for framing a photo would take a photo of, you've arrived in the right space!
            Finally, I've currated some music because... well Music! I love music of all sorts and so should you! in the music section youll find all of the things that jazz me musically!<br>
            Let's all hope you like this and give me that YOUNG CELERY!

            <p>This space will contain all of the teleplays I've authored over the years.  I love to create stories that play out over several arcs.
                Highkers is the story of two friends sharing their weekly escapades with one another.  They follow a strict set of rules for relaying their stories and there are consequeces when the rules are broken.
                Deicide looks at what earthlings do when they find a Civilization developing on a planet Earth intends to colonize. Do we help the burgeoning civilizations or do we enslave them? Deicide is about what happens when humans are given the chance to be GODS.
                Green Rush follows 3 friends in the 1970s as they venture into the hidden world of growing pot.  When One of the triumvriate seemingly dissapears, two friends take up a search that places them in the crosshairs of a drug cartel and a seedy gold mine owning family with a tight grip on 1970's Humboldt County.

          <h1 id="section"><h1>Web Projects</h1>
          <p>Here is the space where I'll place all of my upcoming web projects.  I plan on creating websites that will help politicians and voters connect in more meaningful ways.  I think that the websites should be interactive while allowing for the user to imput as much or as little information as they want.
              I also plan to create a web application that will act as an 'online concierge'.  The service will be an parallel service to websites like AirB&B and VRBO.
              There will also be websites to help people world build, for the purposes of writing fiction or creating games etc. The webapp will allow for the user to input various values that will impact the type of world they create.  i.e. if the USER decides that the planet in their story is <strong>not</strong> in the goldilocks zone of its respective solar system, the app would not allow said plant to be a world of hot deserts.
              The app will allow for users to design a planet from the Macro (Solar System Placement) to the Micro (Civilizations inhabiting the planet) in order to help people create rich an vibrant imaginary worlds!
